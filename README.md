# The Fluid Organisation: A Flywheel of Flow

A whitepaper on designing organisations as dynamic, layered systems—built around coherence, not control.

---

## 🌀 Overview

Most companies push for uniform motion—synchronised delivery cadences across teams, technologies, and products. The result is friction, burnout, and brittle systems.

**The Fluid Organisation** introduces a three-layered architecture:

- **Surface**: High-velocity, exploration-focused product teams  
- **Core**: Stable, reusable infrastructure and platforms  
- **Flywheel**: The dynamic enablement layer that absorbs, filters, and transduces signal into capability

This model draws on engineering metaphors (CVT, hydrodynamics, mantle convection) and applies systems thinking principles to organisational flow.

## 🔍 Inside the Whitepaper

- Why uniform velocity fails and layered motion matters  
- The role of the Flywheel as a transduction system  
- Metrics for coherence: Org Re, Shear Index, Absorption Ratio
- Identified Design Patterns
- Scenarios, playbooks, and triage mechanics  
- Visual models and feedback loops  
- A conclusion grounded in Donella Meadows’ thinking
