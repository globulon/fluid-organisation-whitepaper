\section*{Executive Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Executive Summary}
\textbf{Problem and Opportunity}: Many organisations enforce uniform velocity across all teams, which leads to bottlenecks, burnout, and brittle systems. This misalignment reflects a misunderstanding of flow as opposed to speed.

\textbf{Proposed Model}: A dynamic architecture comprising two primary motion layers (Core and Surface), connected by the Flywheel, a transductive mechanism that continuously adapts pressure, feedback, and flow across layers. Like a continuously variable transmission (CVT), the Flywheel enables infinite gradations of alignment rather than enforcing fixed gears or rigid transitions.

\textbf{Key Mechanisms}: Scale In / Scale Out / Communicate rhythms; high quality interfaces; Primary and Secondary Enablement structures.

\textbf{Measurement}: Metrics such as Signal Uptake, Absorption Ratio, and hydrodynamic analogues (Org Re, Shear Index) serve as indicators of systemic health and the integrity of motion.

\textbf{Outcome}: The model establishes resilient foundations, enables rapid responsiveness at the edge, and facilitates feedback driven evolution. These outcomes are made possible by the Flywheel's dynamic role in converting signal into capability and synchronising motion between the Core and Surface without enforcing uniform speed. These results align closely with Donella Meadows' principles of systemic coherence.

\section{Introduction: From Uniform Velocity to Layered Purpose}
Modern organisations often pursue alignment through synchronised cadence instead of coherent motion. This results in unnecessary friction when platform, governance, and product teams are expected to move at identical speeds. In contrast, nature and resilient systems do not exhibit uniform motion. Rather, their motion is structured, layered, and aligned with purpose.

According to Meadows, such dysfunctions stem from poorly designed feedback loops, misaligned delays, and an excessive focus on control rather than on system purpose. Systems thrive when feedback, flow, and function are harmonised.

\section{A Layered Model for Coherent Flow}
\subsection*{Core Layer}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Stable, deliberate teams providing reusable organisational primitives
  \item Examples include infrastructure, platform, security, and compliance
  \item Motion is high in precision and low in tolerance for rework
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Surface Layer}
\begin{itemize}
  \item High velocity teams engaging with customers and market signals
  \item Examples include product engineering and experimentation squads
  \item Motion is iterative, driven by learning, and responsive to demand pulses
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Flywheel (Enablement System)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Functions as a dynamic interface engine
  \item Transduces Core constraints into accessible form
  \item Converts Surface signals into validated improvements
\end{itemize}

The Flywheel reflects Meadows' model of a feedback loop: a closed, cyclic system where signal and capability circulate instead of progressing linearly. It functions not as organisational glue but as an engine of system coherence.

Enablement within the Flywheel should not be seen as restricted to two static team types. While Primary and Secondary Enablement roles may serve as examples, the system behaves more like a continuously variable transmission---adjusting infinitely based on need, rather than locking into fixed gears. The Flywheel is capable of expanding, subdividing, or hybridising roles to meet specific pressures across domains, markets, or product lines.

In hydrodynamic terms, the Flywheel behaves like a current that connects two layers of differing motion. It resembles the mantle convection within the Earth, which enables energy and material to flow between the molten core and the crust. Just as tectonic plates shift due to deep, circulating pressure gradients, the Flywheel creates organisational motion by linking deep capability with surface experimentation. It operates as a transducer, similar to how thermal energy in the mantle drives surface expansion and subduction. Likewise, in fluid mechanics, velocity profiles in pipes and rivers vary by depth---slowest near the boundary, fastest at the centre. The Flywheel manages these gradients within the organisation, allowing layered velocity without turbulence.
